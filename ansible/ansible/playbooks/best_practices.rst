There are a few key things we need to keep in mind when dealing with the deployment of Avi with Ansible.

- A change in Ansible role values will result in a change in the Avi deployment. Which will likely result in a controller being taken offline for a bit as it restarts with the new service configuration.
- Always, Always verify your values to desired values before execution. Ansible is powerful, it will do what you tell it. Remember: Garbage in, Garbage out.
- Automation makes it less likely to make a mistake, but automation also allows you scale the mistake very rapidly. Always test, or have someone else verify your code prior to execution.

Use Dynamic Inventory when Possible
************************************

If you are deploying Avi in a cloud environment using Ansible, it's best to use Dynamic Inventory. Dynamic Inventory allows an inventory script to be executed and based on parameters return specific hosts based on tags or other values. For further information please see: http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_dynamic_inventory.html

*************************************
How to seperate Staging vs Production
*************************************

When using a static inventory, you will want to seperate staging vs production. These same practices can be applied to Dynamic Inventory as well. For example, using a AWS Tag "environment:production" would group systems in the `ec2_tag_environment_production` group. Our recommendation is to seperate your static hosts between two files for staging and production. This will prevent any possible confusion between what hosts are being executed on prior to running a playbook. An example run would look like

.. code-block:: shell

  ansible-playbook -i production myplaybook.yml

Running it this way will ensure that only the production hosts are being executed against.

***************
Version Control
***************

The use of Version Control software is extremely important. It will help maintain an audit trail, and allow others to verify code changes prior to pulling them into the master or branch used to execute. It's extremely important to have someone verify configuration changes. A simple typo can easily unintentionally down a service or cause interruption.

***********
Vault
***********

We recommend encrypting anything that includes sensitive information, such as password. Ansible has a feature called Vault, which can by the command ``ansible-vault``. Best advice is to create a file named ``vars`` and ``vault``, located in the ``group_vars/`` directory. In the ``vars`` file, define all the possible variables needed, including sensitive ones. Then in the ``vault`` file copy all the sensitive variables over and prefix with ``vault_``. Then in the ``vars`` file point to the matching ``vault_`` variables. Then using ``ansible-vault encrypt vault.yml`` to encrypt your sensitive variables. To decrypt on execution use ``--ask-vault-pass``. When executing your playbook it will prompt for the decrpytion password.
